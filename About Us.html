            Ammara'spiepizza exists as a for-profit hospitality organization that champions unity, development and justice for our guests, 
        our team and our communities in order to lead the charge in creating a positive, long-lasting impact.

            We see pizza as our crispy, chewy, edible passion a platform on which we can imagine all our culinary 
        ambitions. And we believe that our pizza can only be as relevant, radical and creative as the people who 
        make it, support it and love it. As a people-centric company, every decision we make comes from our 
        employees and stakeholders. We believe that our values are the DNA of our company because they are the 
        DNA of our employees. We hire our staff based on their alignment with these Core Values and a passion 
        for community engagement. As a result, though we operate as a for-profit entity, we utilize tenets
         from not-for-profit businesses in our operations by combining profit maximization with a focus on 
         societal improvement.
